1. Policy details and guidance
1.1. Purpose & Scope
Every day we are trusted with the personal data of employees, customers, consumers,
suppliers, and business partners – and we work hard to protect that trust by managing data
fairly and safely, as stated in our Code of Conduct and our Data Privacy policy.
This policy guidance defines the organizational measures that CCEP maintains to ensure
compliance with the principles of our Data Privacy policy and the applicable data privacy laws
and regulations. The Data Privacy policy together with this guidance and the associated
controls constitute the CCEP Data Privacy Programme that sets the standards for CCEP
employees to act in a responsible and transparent way and to ensure personal data entrusted
to CCEP is protected and processed in a fair and lawful manner.
This policy guidance is applicable to all CCEP affiliates, across all business functions and
countries where CCEP processes personal data. All employees who process personal data are
responsible for complying with the Data Privacy Policy, this policy guidance and applicable
data privacy laws and regulations.
1.2. Our Data Privacy Principles
Fairness: Personal data will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent
manner.
Legitimate purpose: Personal data will be collected for specified, legitimate
purposes and will not be processed further in ways that would be incompatible
with those purposes.
Proportionality: Personal data will be adequate, relevant and limited to the
purposes for which it is collected or processed. It will be kept only as long as it is
necessary for the purposes for which it was collected and processed.
Individual rights: CCEP will respect and facilitate the exercise of applicable
individual rights regarding the processing of their personal data.
Security: Appropriate technical and organizational measures will be taken to
prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized
disclosure of, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise
processed. In case of any violation and /or accidental personal data breach, CCEP
will take appropriate steps to end the violation/contain the breach, cooperate
with the competent authorities and inform the data subjects where legally
required.
All employees must respect these principles when processing personal data, and process
owners need to ensure that these principles are embedded in our business processes.

1.3. CCEP Data Privacy Controls
1.3.1 Governance
The Data Privacy Programme is part of CCEP’s Ethics & Compliance Programme led by the
Chief Compliance Officer, based in Belgium at Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Services SPRL.
This Programme reports into the Compliance & Risk Committee and the Audit Committee.
The Chief Data Protection Officer (CDPO) is the enterprise lead of the CCEP Data Privacy
Programme and is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Data Privacy policy. He
reports to the Chief Compliance Officer and is responsible for providing guidance to the Data
Privacy Programme, promoting compliance with applicable regulations, defining
organizational requirements in alignment with applicable local and international legal
requirements.
The Privacy Office is a multi-disciplinary team that manages the Data Privacy Programme
operations to ensure that it meets its goals and is communicated effectively within the
enterprise. The Privacy Office also ensures that the members of the Privacy Community are
properly involved.
The Privacy Office consists of:
• The Chief Data Protection Officer (CDPO)
• A representative of HR Compliance
• A representative of Labour Relations
• A representative of Information Security
• The local DPO’s
• The Privacy Programme manager
• Other functional representatives on an ad-hoc basis and on invitation
The local Data Protection Officer (DPO) acts as the official primary point of contact for the
local Data Protection Authority (DPA). Such role will be registered with the DPA in the
countries where CCEP operates and where this role is mandatory. The CDPO or alternatively
a local member of the Privacy Office may be registered as local DPO.
The Privacy Programme Manager is responsible for organizing and coordinating the activities
of the Data Privacy Programme in line with the Framework, and in such manner to enable the
demonstration of CCEP’s Privacy accountability if required.
The functional representatives for People&Culture, Labour Relations and Information
Security represent their respective functional area in the Privacy Office and in the
management of the Data Privacy Programme.

The Privacy Community consists of the members of the Privacy Office, the Local Data Privacy
Coordinators and the Functional Data Privacy Coordinators.
The Local Data Privacy Coordinators (LDPC’s) are responsible for coordinating, reporting and
promoting compliance with locally applicable data protection regulations in alignment with
the CCEP Data Privacy Programme for a defined geography. The LDPC takes the necessary
initiatives in order to ensure that the local legal entities comply with the specific local privacy
requirements. The LDPC is the local contact point for the Privacy Office.
The Functional Data Privacy Coordinators (FDPC’s) are responsible for coordinating and
promoting compliance with applicable data protection regulations in alignment with the CCEP
Data Privacy Programme within their area of expertise. The FDPC coordinates with the Privacy
Office in order to ensure that the activities and projects in his functional or business area
comply with privacy requirements. The FDPC is the functional contact point for the Privacy
Office.
The CDPO and Privacy Office will support the LDPC’s and FDPC’s through the community calls
and other communications for tracking regulatory changes, follow-up on specific actions and
updates on the Data Privacy Programme global components.
How can you play your part?
In doubt, ask! The Privacy Office and the associated Community members are available for
your questions or requests. Understand roles and responsibilities. Know your Local Data
Privacy Coordinator. You can find the list of contact persons on the Privacy Portal “Make
Privacy Personal” or contact the Privacy Office via privacy@ccep.com
1.3.2 Data inventories and Data transfer mechanisms
We maintain an inventory of processing activities, Personal Data storage and related data
flows.
• Records of Processing Activities (RoPA) are documented centrally and locally in a
shared repository with the support of the process owners
• Cross border data flows must be identified through the maintenance of the RoPA
• Standard Contractual Clauses and other legal mechanisms for cross-border transfers
must be executed where appropriate
How can you play your part?
It is the duty of each process owner to support the maintenance of the RoPA. New Personal
Data Processing Activities and associated systems should be reported to the Privacy Office.
When exporting Personal Data out of the EEA the legal mechanism for transfer should be
verified.

• An internal process is maintained for addressing the different types of requests •
The Privacy Office keeps track of the requests and maintain metrics
How can you play your part?
Each employee may request to exercise his rights through the procedure detailed in the
employee Privacy notice. In each functional area, where necessary, support must be given to
the Privacy Office to respond to Data Subject Rights Requests.
1.3.9 Privacy by Design
We monitor operational practices, to identify new processes or changes to existing processes
and ensure the implementation of Privacy by Design principles:
• All new projects go through a “Project Portfolio Management” process which includes
a Privacy Threshold Assessment (QuickScan) for identification and remediation of
Privacy risks.
• A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) process will be initiated where high risks
are identified by a QuickScan threshold assessment
How can you play your part?
Each project owner in charge of a new processing activity that includes the collection or use
of Personal Data should initiate a QuickScan (or pre-DPIA). This can be done automatically as
part of the PPM process or by reaching out to the Privacy Office on
privacyassessments@ccep.com for projects that do not go through the PPM process.
1.3.10 Privacy incidents & breach management
We maintain an effective data privacy incident and breach management programme in
coordination with other functional areas of CCEP:
• Data privacy incidents are tracked and managed in coordination with IT through a
ticketing system
• A breach management procedure, including notification protocol, is maintained in
coordination with Information Security and the Compliance teams
• The Privacy Office maintains a log of incidents and breaches
How can you play your part?

in Service Now or by contacting directly the Privacy Office.
1.3.11 Self-assessments & audits
We verify that operational practices comply with the privacy policy and operational policies
and procedures through self-assessments, walk-throughs and audits:
• The Privacy Office maintains a self-assessment scorecard based on the Data Privacy
Programme Framework. This self-assessment also includes the links to the evidences
that allows the Privacy Office to demonstrate CCEP’s accountability in this area.
• Audits are regularly performed by CCEP’s Internal Audit team. Such audits may relate
to the Data Privacy Programme itself, to a specific local or functional implementation
effectiveness or to third party related risks.
How can you play your part?
The maturity of CCEP’s Privacy Program is regularly evaluated through self-assessments and
audits. Employees involved in the processing of Personal Data may be requested to provide
input to such assessments or audits.
